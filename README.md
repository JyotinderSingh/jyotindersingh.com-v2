# Source Code for jyotindersingh.com

Website design inspired by [Brittany Chiang](https://github.com/bchiang7)

Written using React and Chakra UI, topped off with some CSS modules.

I've tried my best to make this website as performant, responsive, and accessible as possible.

Any feedback is super welcome :)
